                I am a student at Strathmore University, pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Informatics and Computer Science. 
                As a dedicated computer science student, I possess a strong foundation in programming and web development. 
                I am proficient in HTML, PHP, CSS, MySQL, Git and JavaScript, just to mention a few. 
                I also have experience with the Laravel framework which enhances my ability to build good and robust applications efficiently. 
                I am also skilled in using design software such as Figma and Draw.io, which are essential during project planning to create intuitive user interfaces. 
                My effective project management skills allow me to effectively coordinate tasks, prioritize deliverables and ensure timely completion of objectives. 
                I do well in collaborative environments by valuing the expertise of my teammates. 
                I am eager and open to learning and improving as I look to thrive in my area of expertise.
